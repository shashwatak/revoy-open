The code in this project is largely the work of Shashwat Kandadai, however all of this work is made possible thanks to the team of people designing, building, testing, maintaining, deploying a fleet of robots, and serving paying customers:

- Bayne Smith
- Beverly Morrison
- Catherine Shepherd
- Ian Rust
- Jason Hinesly
- Letian Lee
- Muhammad Ahsan
- Nemo Jin
- Peter Reinhardt
- Roland Blackwell
- Sami Rajala

This code relies on many open-source projects, most significantly

- projectchrono
- ompl
- foxglove and mcap
- bazel
- podman and buildah
- clang
- gcc
- linux: ubuntu and fedora
- python
- git
- TODO: add any more to this list that may have been forgotten by accident.
