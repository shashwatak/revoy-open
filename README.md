The code in this project is largely the work of Shashwat Kandadai, however none of this work would have been possible without the team of people, designing, building, testing, maintaining, and deploying a fleet of robots, serving paying customers:

- Bayne Smith
- Beverly Morrison
- Catherine Shepherd
- Ian Rust
- Jason Hinesly
- Letian Lee
- Muhammad Ahsan
- Nemo Jin
- Peter Reinhardt
- Roland Blackwell
- Sami Rajala
- Selina Pan
- Shaochun Ye
- Shashwat Kandadai
- Sina Nejati
- Yan Aolan
- Zach Wiley

This code relies on many open-source projects, most significantly

- projectchrono
- ompl
- foxglove / mcap
- bazel
- podman / buildah
- clang
