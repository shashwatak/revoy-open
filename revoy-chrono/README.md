# RevoyChrono

Implementation of the Revoy ChWheeledVehicle to be used for 3D simulation.

port of the stuff that [Ian Rust](ian@sixwheel.com) made in the [Sixwheel Chrono Fork](github.com/sixwheel-inc/projectchrono)

Also some utilities for improved irrlicht usage, and mcap usage, and ensuring chrono data files are found at runtime.
